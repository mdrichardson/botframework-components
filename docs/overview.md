# Component model documentation overview

## Table of Contents

1. **Overview**
2. [Managing packages for your bot](manage-packages.md)
3. [Extending your bot with code](extending-with-code.md)
4. [Creating your own packages](create-packages.md)
5. [Creating custom actions](create-custom-actions.md)

## Overview

This folder contains documentation for creating components and working with packages. When these features are made generally available, this documentation will migrate to [https://docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com).

## Notes

In this folder there are both concept and how-to articles.

Concept:

- Extending with Code

How-to

- Creating packages
- Create custom action
- Install packages
- Create packages

There will eventually be additional how-to articles for creating additional component types - middleware, storage providers, adapters, etc.

Long-term, essentially the entire SDK documentation falls under the "extend your bot with code" story (minus a lot of the waterfall dialog stuff). As we iterate through samples and scenarios we should map the existing SDK articles and concepts to articles in this section.
