# Component model documentation overview

In this folder there are both concept and how-to articles.

Concept:

- Extending with Code
- Using packages (unsure if a concept article is needed here, not currently included)

How-to

- Creating packages
- create custom action
- install packages
- create packages

There will eventually be additional how-to articles for creating additional component types - middleware, storage providers, adapters, etc.

Long-term, essentially the entire SDK documentation falls under the "extend your bot with code" story (minus a lot of the waterfall dialog stuff). As we iterate through samples and scenarios we should map the existing SDK articles and concepts to articles in this section.
